# Disco dancing my way through Elysium

## Review Score
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

## Abridged Review
Tallinn is rich in the elements that underly a truly great city: an entrepreneurial spirit, a vibrant artistic culture, and a rich and proud history that results in a strong national identity despite only becoming independent of the USSR in 1991. 
Though not the first place one would think when considering the great cities of the world, I found it to be among the strongest candidates in the world and I believe that it could be at the center of massive developments in the future. 
Whether it was the affordable and top notch food, diving into an underwater soviet prison, or the generosity of the locals, I could not have been more impressed by it.


### Highlights
- Kiek in de Kök (bastion and tunnels)
- Rummu (underwater soviet prison)
- Telliskivi Creative City (hipster haven)
- Niguliste (the birthplace of Estonia)
- Linnahall (soviet concert hall with a massive stage)

## Restaurants
### Rataskaevu 16
*Traditional Estonian with a modern twist*
Essentially a michelin star resturant for 30 euros a head.

### Saiakangi Kohvik
*Coffee and the best pastries in town*
The gluten free nut pastry in particular was the greatest.


## Icons
### Tallinn Old Town
Medieval walls and cobblestone streets define this UNESCO World Heritage site.
